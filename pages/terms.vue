      <h3>Terms of Service</h3>
      This website (<a href="https://tncovidbeds.netlify.app" target="_blank"
        >https://tncovidbeds.netlify.app</a
      >) is designed, developed, and maintained by a bunch of volunteers from
      Tamil Nadu who have been helping friends and family find Covid beds in
      nearby hospitals. The main developer of this page lost his dad to Covid
      last year and some of us lost relatives. This is a small tribute to them
      in a hope that it helps someone else in need.
      <br />
      This site will remain free forever and will never indulge in any form of
      advertisements.
